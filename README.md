# The Knight's Tour

A backtracking algorithm for finding the knight's tour.

## Algo

Begin with:
 - Representation of visited squares.
 - Algorithm for determining legal moves from representation of visited squares.

Process(Position):
 - From the Position build a stack of legal moves.
 - While(stack !empty)
    - Pop the top one, start Process based on this square.
